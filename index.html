        Welcome! We are Tim and Sara (or "Rhythm of Rose," a product of Tim's last name), and we believe that music has the power to inspire love and infuse any celebration with joy.
        As a recently engaged couple, we understand that finding the perfect music for your wedding ceremony may not only be stressful (where do you start?)
        but also expensive.
        We work full-time and, after playing music together for the past few years, have decided to offer our violin + guitar musical stylings
        to weddings and other celebrations in the Chicagoland area.

        <h5>
          After becoming a piano and sax pro at a young age, Tim realized that the guitar offered much more success with the ladies.
          He taught himself to play in highschool and has been crooning to Mumford and Sons and The Avett Brothers ever since.
          He even proposed to Sara by guitar and song!

        <img class="media-object" src="Saraviolin.jpg" height=215>
        <h5>
          Sara was taught by Suzuki Strings starting at age 4 and traveled with the company throughout her childhood.
          In highschool she decided to pursue other sports, but always knew she would come back to her violin.
          After settling in to life in Chicago in her 20s, she began taking private lessons and playing with an adult ensemble.
          She loves weddings and knew she wanted to share wedding music after having the chance to play in her friend's ceremony.
